PYGObject Installation
======================

Follow the below instructions to get started with PYGObject which works with the Webkit and GTK stuff.

Linux Instructions
------------------

* The Python webkit should already be installed.

Windows Instructions
--------------------

* Dependencies:

	`Python 3.0-3.4 <https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/>`_ (newest version is 3.5 but won't work)

* Download `PYGObject <https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/>`_ for Windows and install just like any other non-Webkit, normal, user-friendly, no bs program.

* Run the downloaded installer

* When asked if you have the protable python installation, click 'No'

* When asked for the version of Python, choose 3.x (but not 3.5)

* Next you need to choose which libraries to install.  Please install the following:

  - JSON-glib 1.0.4 (maybe will come in handy)
  - Glib-Controller 0.1.1git (for the JSON one, also may be helpful)
  - GTK+ 3.18.9 (necessary)
  - WebkitGTK 2.2.8 (necessary)
  - Webkit2GTK 2.2.8 (just in case)

* Click NEXT. You will get another list of libraries. From this one select:

  - Log4g 0.1.2 (may come in handy?)
  - Mongo-glib 0.3.2

* Click NEXT. You will get another dialog box with a much shorter list of libraries. Select this one:

  - Glade 3.18

* Click NEXT. You will get a dialog box asking “Ready to install?”. Click YES.

* You will get a progress bar and a few Terminal windows will open and it will seem like you're in the Matrix or you are being hacked. You're not. Maybe, I don't know.
