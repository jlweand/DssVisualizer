Python Libraries Used
=====================

Linux
-----
* Open a new terminal and install::

	apt-get install python3-pip
	pip3 install pymongo
	pip3 install elasticsearch
	pip3 install pytz
	pip3 install tzlocal
	pip3 install python-dateutil
	pip3 install ujson


Windows
-------

* Open a cmd window and install::

	pip install pymongo
    pip install elasticsearch
	pip install pytz
	pip install tzlocal
	pip install python-dateutil
    pip install ujson

If you have issues with ujson:

* If you get the error: Unable to find vcvarsall.bat error you will need to do some troubleshooting.  It needs to compile some stuff and it is missing Visual Studio’s C++ libraries.

* Option 1: So head on out to https://www.visualstudio.com/ and download Visual Studio.  Make sure you install Common Tools for Visual C++

	- If you are installing ujson for Python 3.5 this is all you need to do.
	- If you are installing ujson for Pythong 3.4 you’ll also need to run the following command
		set VS100COMNTOOLS=%VS140COMNTOOLS%

	- Now run the pip install ujson command again.

*	Option 2: You can also go try to find the precompiled binary version of ujson and install that instead of dealing with Visual Studio
