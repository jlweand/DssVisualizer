Installation of Renderer and Datasource Plugins
===============================================

Plugin Installation
-------------------

To prepare a plugin for installation:

1. The name of the plugin folder you wish to install can only contain letters, numbers and underscores.
2. Copy plugin folder into the "DssVisualizer/app/plugins/(datasource or renderer)" folder
   depending on the functionality of the plugin. Already installed, you will find MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
   These are in the "DssVisualizer/app/plugins/datasource" folder while Vis.js is in the "DssVisualizer/app/plugins/renderer"
   folder.
3. Once the plugin folder is copied into the appropriate plugin directory, the DSS Visualizer can be started or restarted.
   Go to the Administrator page and click on the "Install Plugin" tab. The new plugin should appear as an option in one of the dropdown
   menus in the "Install Plugin" tab of the Administrator page of the DSS Visualizer.
4. Once the desired plugin appears in one of the dropdown menus, select it and click on the "Install" button and your plugin
   will be installed.
